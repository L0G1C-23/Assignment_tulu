# AI Message Triage System

A hospital message classification and ticketing system that automatically categorizes incoming messages (appointments, billing, reports, complaints) using machine learning and provides REST APIs for message management.

##  Project Overview

This system uses scikit-learn to train a text classification model that categorizes hospital messages into four categories:Appointment, Billing,Reports, Complaint.
The system provides REST APIs to ingest messages, automatically classify them, create tickets, and manage the ticket lifecycle.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the ML Model
```bash
python train.py
```

Expected output:
```
Appointment F1: 0.902
Billing F1: 0.880
Reports F1: 0.875
Complaint F1: 0.900
Macro F1: 0.889

```

### 3. Start the API Server
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Test Different Message Types

**Appointment:**

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Can I schedule a visit with Dr. Smith tomorrow?"}'
```

**Billing:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "What will be the cost of my surgery?"}'
```

**Reports:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I am still waiting for my blood test results"}'
```

**Complaint:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The waiting time was too long and staff was rude"}'
```

Actual billing           1        22         0         2  
Actual reports           0         0        21         4
Actual complaint         1         2         1        21
```

### Key Metrics
- **Overall Accuracy**: 88.5%

## üîç Advanced Features

### Model Interpretability
The system uses TF-IDF vectorization, making it interpretable. Key features learned by the model include:

- **Appointment**: "book", "schedule", "appointment", "doctor", "visit"
- **Billing**: "cost", "bill", "payment", "insurance", "charges"  
- **Reports**: "results", "report", "test", "lab", "records"
- **Complaint**: "complaint", "unhappy", "waiting", "rude", "dissatisfied"

### Extensibility
The system is designed to be easily extended:

- **New Categories**: Add more labels to the dataset and retrain
- **Better Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Add user management and API authentication
- **Real-time Processing**: Integrate with message queues (Redis, RabbitMQ)
- **Advanced ML**: Experiment with transformer models or ensemble methods

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "ML model not loaded" error**
```bash
# Solution: Train the model first
python train.py
```

**2. "FileNotFoundError: data/messages.csv"**
```bash
# Solution: Ensure the CSV file is in the data/ directory
mkdir -p data
# Then add the messages.csv file to data/ directory
```

**3. Import errors**
```bash
# Solution: Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Port already in use**
```bash
# Solution: Use a different port
uvicorn app:app --port 8001 --reload
```

## üìà Future Improvements

1. **Database Integration**: Implement SQLite with SQLAlchemy for persistent storage
2. **User Authentication**: Add JWT-based authentication for API security
3. **Advanced ML**: Experiment with transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better accuracy
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for real-time ticket updates
5. **Dashboard**: Web interface for ticket management and analytics
6. **Message Queue**: Integration with RabbitMQ/Redis for high-throughput scenarios
7. **Monitoring**: Add logging, metrics, and health monitoring
8. **Multi-language**: Support for messages in multiple languages
