# üè• AI Message Triage System

A hospital message classification and ticketing system that automatically categorizes incoming messages (appointments, billing, reports, complaints) using machine learning and provides REST APIs for message management.

## üìã Project Overview

This system uses scikit-learn to train a text classification model that categorizes hospital messages into four categories:
- **Appointment**: Scheduling, booking, rescheduling requests
- **Billing**: Payment, insurance, cost-related queries
- **Reports**: Lab results, medical records, test reports
- **Complaint**: Service issues, feedback, concerns

The system provides REST APIs to ingest messages, automatically classify them, create tickets, and manage the ticket lifecycle.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the ML Model
```bash
python train.py
```

Expected output:
```

## üß† ML Model Details

### Architecture
- **Vectorizer**: TfidfVectorizer with unigrams and bigrams
- **Classifier**: LogisticRegression with balanced class weights
- **Features**: 5000 max features, min_df=2, English stop words removed

### Performance Metrics
- **Dataset**: 104 balanced samples across 4 categories
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 stratified
- **Macro F1 Score**: ~0.89
- **Individual Class F1 Scores**: 0.87-0.90

### Confidence Threshold
- Messages with confidence < 0.7 are flagged with `"triage_required": true`
- High-confidence predictions are automatically processed

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Test Different Message Types

**Appointment:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Can I schedule a visit with Dr. Smith tomorrow?"}'
```

**Billing:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "What will be the cost of my surgery?"}'
```

**Reports:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/predict" \
